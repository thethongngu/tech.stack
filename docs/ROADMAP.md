# Tech Stack Explorer and Picker Roadmap

This document outlines the long‐term plan for the Tech Stack Explorer and Picker application.

## 1. Core Features

### 1.1 Explorer
- **Technology Catalog**
  - Comprehensive, searchable list of technologies and SaaS services.
  - Rich metadata: description, pricing, pros/cons, links, and use cases.
  - Categorize technologies (databases, hosting, frameworks, payments, etc.).

- **Search and Filtering**
  - Text search over name and description.
  - Filtering by category, price tier, maturity, and other attributes.
  - Faceted filtering for quick narrowing of results.

- **Detail View**
  - Full page for each technology with detailed info, screenshots, tutorials, and community reviews.
  - Show related technologies or alternatives.

### 1.2 Picker
- **Wizard-style Questionnaire**
  - Multiple-choice questions on project type, preferred language, budget, scalability needs, etc.
  - Capture answers at each step to compute final recommendations.

- **Recommendation Engine**
  - Rules-based approach using scored weights or decision rules.
  - Present chosen stack with rationale for each technology.

- **Persistence**
  - Allow users to revisit previous answers or restart the questionnaire.
  - Save progress locally or in user profiles when accounts are added.

### 1.3 Accounts and Personalization (future)
- User accounts to save favorite stacks, rate technologies, and post reviews or tips.
- "My Picks" page for revisiting prior recommendations.

## 2. Additional Potential Features
1. **Comparison Tool** – side-by-side feature and cost comparisons.
2. **Community Contributions** – user-submitted reviews, tips, or recipes with moderation.
3. **API** – external access to technology data or questionnaire results.
4. **Integration Tutorials** – step-by-step guides or code snippets for popular stacks.

## 3. Technical Considerations
- **Next.js** frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind for styling.
- **Search Service** such as Meilisearch or Algolia for large datasets.
- **Recommendation Logic** starts as rules-based, with potential ML enhancements later.
- **Account System** using OAuth or email-based auth.
- **Deployment** via Vercel or container-based infrastructure with CI/CD.
